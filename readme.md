# Set a custom date range for DuckDuckGo searches on Firefox

In DuckDuckGo on Firefox, I always end up choosing a date range.  DDG used to allow advanced settings (I think?) but this option is gone now.

A Javascript bookmarklet can set a URL where you can set specific things, but that's still user work & not automated.

Simplest code is to insert "&df=y" into the GET method (since I usually pick "in the last year")

Looks like a Firefox extension can do this, I will go down this path.  Tutorial
